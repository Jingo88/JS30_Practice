    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // DIFFERENT WAYS TO MAKE COPIES OF AN ARRAY

    const team2 = players.slice(); 
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team4 = [...players]; // ES6 spread operator will take all the values from the iterable and insert them into the container
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
        name:  "Jason Ng",
        age: 28
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // THIS IS STILL A REFERENCE 
    // const other = person;
    // other.age = 35;
    // console.log(person)
    // Still changing person

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const other2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 35})
    console.log(other2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // Object.assign only makes value copies one level deep. 
    // So if you are copying a object with nested data structures those nested items will be references

    const jason = {
        name: "Jason",
        age : 28,
        social: {
            twitter: "@jsoning",
            facebook: "idk"
        }
    }

    // const dev = Object.assign({}, jason);
    // dev.social.facebook = "yes you do"
    // // Both console logs will have "yes you do"
    // console.log(jason);
